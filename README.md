# web-scraping-challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to using webscraping to pull Mars info and images from various websites.

The app.py contains the different routes using pymongo and flask to host the website locally. One route is for running the scraper.py file, effectively scraping the webpages to collect data and saving the information as variables. 

Finally, the index.html page collects all the information needed from our scraper and presents the Mars information.
